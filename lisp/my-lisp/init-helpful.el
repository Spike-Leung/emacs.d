  ;; and macros. `helpful-function' is functions only, so we provide
  ;; `helpful-callable' as a drop-in replacement.

  ;; Lookup the current symbol at point. C-c C-d is a common keybinding
  ;; for this in lisp modes.

  ;; Look up *F*unctions (excludes macros).

  ;; By default, C-h F is bound to `Info-goto-emacs-command-node'. Helpful
  ;; already links to the manual, if a function is referenced there.
